# Vue3 + Vite + PagedJs Starter
This repository is a starter for using the web to print library [PagedJs](https://pagedjs.org/) with Vue3 and Vite.

This uses the PagedJS npm package configured to work as the [polyfill js file](https://unpkg.com/browse/pagedjs@0.4.1/dist/) except without the autoloading of the polyfill.

We used this setup to build the [hybrid.publishing.systems](https://hybrid.publishing.systems) frontend in the course Hybrid Publishing at the University of Applied Sciences Mainz.
